# Amazon Refrigerators Data Web Scraping and BI Dashboard
This project demonstrates my exploration of web scraping, data cleaning, and business intelligence (BI) dashboard creation. I scraped refrigerator data from Amazon, cleaned and processed it, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to practice data manipulation and analysis techniques.

Key steps involved:

Web Scraping:

Used Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract data related to refrigerators from Amazon's product listings.
Data Cleaning:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and consistency, removing any unnecessary or incomplete information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to gain insights into the data, including visualizations of key metrics such as price, ratings, brand distribution, and other relevant attributes.
Business Intelligence Dashboard:

Created an interactive BI dashboard using tools like Power BI or Tableau to visualize the data and insights in a user-friendly way.
While the goal of this project was not to perform in-depth business analysis, it allowed me to practice my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and dashboard creation.
